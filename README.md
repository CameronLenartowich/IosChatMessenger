## How to install (Note: I have not yet tested these instructions)
1. Clone this repository into an empty folder on your computer.
```
git clone https://github.com/CameronLenartowich/IosChatMessenger

2. cd into the project
```
cd <cloned-repository-name>
```
3. run 
```
npm i
```
4. run 
```
npm start
``` 
5. Press "i"
6. A localhost tab should now be open in your browser containing expo information. Click "Run on ios simulator" in the bottom left corner of the page. If that fails you may open it as a web page but know that styles will appear different in this mode.
